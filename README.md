Scripts for my personal use

`flash.bat`: flash latest official TWRP and patched vbmeta image on Redmi Note 8/8T, then boots TWRP. fastboot binaries, `twrp-3.4.0-1-ginkgo.img` and `vbmeta.img` must be in the same folder as the script.

`ubuntu-android-env.sh`: setup an AOSP build environment on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (should work on Ubuntu 20.04-based distros too)
